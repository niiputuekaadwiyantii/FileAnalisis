# Bike Rentals - Final Project for Data Analytics with Python Dicoding

This serves as the concluding assignment for the 'Learn Data Analysis with Python' course on Dicoding, where I utilized the bike sharing dataset to conduct analysis and develop a dashboard. Within the notebook, I've documented the process of Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data Visualization. Additionally, I've employed Streamlit to craft the dashboard.

## 2. Project work steps
1. Data Wrangling: 
 - Gathering data
 - Assessing data
 - Cleaning data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
 - Defined business questions for data exploration
 - Create Data exploration
3. Data Visualization:
 - Create Data Visualization to answer business questions
4. Dashboard:
 - Set up the DataFrame which will be used
 - Make filter components on the dashboard
 - Complete the dashboard with data visualizations


## 3. Starting
### `notebook.ipynb`
1. Download this project.
2. Open your IDE like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory.
3. Create a New Notebook.
4. Upload and select the file with .ipynb extension.
5. Connect to hosted runtime.
6. And run the code cells.

### `dashboard/dashboard.py`
1. Download this project.
2. Install the Streamlit in your terminal or command prompt using `pip install streamlit`.
3. Install libraries like pandas, numpy, plotly, matplotlib, and seaborn if you haven't.
3. Please keep in note that do not move the csv file because it acts a data source. keep it in one folder as dashboard.py
4. Open your VSCode and run the file by clicking the terminal and write it `streamlit run dashboard.py` in your terminal.
